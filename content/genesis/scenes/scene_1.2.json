  "narration": "Silence does a trick: it gets louder. The Ledger lowers its hum until you feel it in the places your heartbeat hides—behind the tongue, inside the wrists, at the soft hinge where the ribs forget they are cages. Light sheens the stone like breath on glass, and for a long, weighty instant the vault looks at each of you with the kind of attention most people never meet in a lifetime.\\n\\nMood settles over the chamber like weather. It is not a single feeling, not exactly. More like a chord with changing names depending on who listens: courage tastes it as warmth, caution as clean air, cleverness as a puzzle generous enough to be solved, mischief as a stage with perfect lighting. The gremlins feel it as permission and immediately misuse it.\\n\\nYou did not come for praise. Good: the Ledger does not offer it. You came for an answer the world has the bad habit of asking every time you walk into a room: *Who are you, really?* The Ledger replies the only way the honest ever do—by showing you a mirror and refusing to lie.\\n\\nThis is the part after the dare and before the door. The part where intentions harden into instruments. Where your class isn’t just flavor but physics. Where the vault writes a mood into your bones and lets you keep it if you can carry the weight.\\n\\nSomewhere beyond the next wall, something heavy and careful turns a second blade in a sheath you hope is decorative. A breath like winter drifts through a seam you can’t find, and the hum writes a patient question across your ribs: *Are you scaffolds, or are you knives?*",
