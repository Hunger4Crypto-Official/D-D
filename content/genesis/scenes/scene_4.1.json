    "narration": "The Radiant Confluence exhales you into the Auric Stratiform, a suspended plaza of ledger stone latticed with dawn-colored glass. The floor is a tessellation of spirals and polygons that glow in golden-ratio pulses, mapping your footsteps into recursive signatures. Every pane remembers an oath from prior acts; every breath condenses into a ledger entry written in slowly turning numerals. Above, an array of mirrored sails catches consensus winds and refracts them into ribboned auroras that flicker through hidden difficulty tiers\u2014violet for effortless grace, amber for the expected struggle, infrared for outcomes that only desperate or brilliant players will ever see. The air tastes like steamed citrus and molten copper, and each inhale threads a strand of encouragement into your lungs.\n\nGremlin factions have converged here to herald Act Four. The Auric Quorum arrive first, their capes sewn from invoice vellum that rustles with polite threats. They bow with theatrical sincerity, chirping that the Stratiform has waited for you since Act One. Orbiting them are the Prism Current engineers from the Confluence, Chronoloom timekeepers, and a band of Ledger Scribes balancing abaci in their tails. Banter crackles between them in gremlin ledger-speak: dev jokes about dawn deploys, traders quoting spread between sunrise and sunset, miners timing heartbeats with pickaxe swings. They have rigged AFK gimbals on every railing, promising that anyone idle for more than twenty-four hours will be gently slingshotted into forced-play loops until they remember how to laugh.\n\nSeven terraces spiral outward from the central ledger plinth. Each terrace hosts a ritual: the first sets the harmonic GM/GN greeting, the second weaves new consensus threads, the third fashions soft-power equipment, the fourth blossoms into a pity-backed shop, the fifth revives the fallen, the sixth calibrates a spectrum door aimed at the horizon, and the seventh ratifies the act\u2019s first vote. Between terraces, slender bridges arch over pools of encrypted water where ledger fish flicker into being whenever someone tells a joke worth logging. Arrivals shimmer in from peripheral spectrum doors mid-scene, backpacks bulging with mystery items or empty pockets hungry for pity currency.\n\nThe Auric Stratiform is a living worksheet. Every action stamps a glyph, and every glyph contributes to a golden spiral of progression that winds toward a horizon you can\u2019t yet see. The gremlins grin with pointed teeth, waving you toward the first terrace where a double sunrise waits to learn your names.",
