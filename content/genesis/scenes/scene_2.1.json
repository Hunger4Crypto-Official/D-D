  "narration": "The hall ahead narrows until the air itself seems to pass with shoulders drawn in. Brass ribs bow overhead like the inside of a cautious throat. Each step lands on a tile that is not a tile but an opinion about how steps should behave: measured, squared, declared. Lanterns are set into the walls not as decoration but as witnesses, each with a bevel for notes and a habit of clearing its throat before you get clever. Between ribs, a pale vapor moves as though remembering where it was supposed to be. The floor is etched with small numerals that count, not the number of feet, but the number of intentions per foot. A gremlin rides a rolling abacus and stops every few meters to push a bead and whisper, \"For the record.\"\\n\\nHere, patience is a door and the hinge is your weight. Trust is respected, but tested—here it must cite sources. Insight is welcomed, but red-lined for clarity. Gremlin antics are tolerated with fines payable in the currency of snacks. Above all, the Corridor despises the sprint that forgets to breathe. It likes checklists. It likes proofs. It likes you best when you move like a sentence that knows where it is going and why it takes its commas seriously.\\n\\nThere are seven checkpoints in the first span: the Pace Gate (counts cadence and mercy toward ankles), the Weight Ledger (does your burden match your claim), the Breath Bar (inhale, exhale, don’t lie), the Rune Gloss (do you name what you read), the Gremlin Kiosk (compliance snacks; fines inevitable), the Proof Niche (receipts for posture), and the Promise Ring (a small ritual of future intent written in present tense). None of these are bosses. All of them are auditors with kind eyes. The Corridor’s scent is metal cooled responsibly and parchment dried on a clothesline. The first lantern coughs politely. The abacus squeaks, and a bead slides with the sound of a tiny judgment dressed as encouragement.",
