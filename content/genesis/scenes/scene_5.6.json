    "title": "The Wake Cathedra — Penultimate Accord",
    "narration": "The Wake Cathedra crowns the void like a cathedral grown from ledger light and remixed storms. Vaulted ribs of magnetized moonstone hold entire fleets in patient suspension. Choir lines of glasswork arch overhead, capturing the glow of every oath minted in the previous scenes. Banners stitched from memory spool in quiet winds that come from nowhere; they smell faintly of rain on hot rails. Beneath it all, the floor is a mosaic of four braided rivers flowing toward a single altar. Each river is bright enough to throw shadows and deep enough to drown regrets.\n\nThe dais sits at the intersection of every fate lane you have cultivated. Loss, Hide, Live, and Win spiral like constellations around the altar, each lane carrying its own cadence, its own color, its own promise to the final battlefront. The Wake Reckoning's mirrored descent empties out here, and all your reflections stand with you, arms crossed, eyes bright, waiting for the penultimate accord. They hum with the same anticipation you feel in your bones: the last chance to balance the ledger before you spend yourselves forever.\n\nPilgrim-compilers from Act Four have built scaffolds of shimmering data along the perimeters. Engineers patch the void with braids of tetherlight that keep the Cathedra locked against the enemy's gravity wells. The grease smell of machines mingles with incense distilled from raw time. Gremlins swing from pew to pew threading cables made of vow-silk; traders run tables beneath the arches, swapping miracles for promissory ballads. Whales circulate slow as weather, pulling in collapsed comets to feed the Cathedra's engines. Hackers etch counter-scripts across the nave, their code coiling like luminous ivy up the columns.\n\nEverywhere you look there are altars for specific endings. The Loss altar burns with steady blue flame waiting for the names of those who will spend themselves without return. The Hide altar is cloaked in layered veils, each one a map to a sanctuary no enemy can parse. The Live altar thrums with medics and logisticians weaving rescue nets, promising to pull as many as possible out of the coming fire. The Win altar bristles with spear-points, coordinates, and war songs rehearsed until the syllables sharpen like blades. The Cathedra does not ask you to choose just one; it demands you uplift all four simultaneously.\n\nRemembering the rules set back in 1.1, every choice writes itself in light. Here, light becomes cathedral stone, and the stone listens. Some will die and require a procession that dignifies the cost. Some will hide and need cloaks no pursuit can pierce. Some will live and yearn for hearths that can be rebuilt in a single night. Some will win and must be aimed with the precision of a starmap. The Cathedra's vault hears the distinctions, translates them into resonant chords, and waits for you to direct the choir.\n\nThis is the second-to-last scene, the inhale before Act Five's final exhale. The ledger-clock ticks audibly along the nave, each chime a reminder that hesitation is another kind of defeat. Yet the Cathedra offers time in the form of tasks, each beat a ritual that fortifies a lane. Walk the mosaics slowly, feel the heat of the Loss river, the cool of Hide, the pulse of Live, the storm of Win. Every step is a vow, every vow another stone mortared into the eventual triumph or the necessary sacrifice.\n\nWhen you stand at the center, the altar recognizes the sum of the crews that followed you from the Wakefront and beyond. The structure unfurls new balconies to hold those arriving from 4.6 and 4.7, ensuring the Convergence Causeway's promises carry forward. The Cathedra is luminous, somber, relentless; it expects you to answer with work equal to its glow. Raise your hands, queue the rounds, and pour everything you have left into this penultimate accord. The next scene will judge whether the ledger closes in glory, in mourning, in shelter, or in defiant survival. Tonight you prepare for all four at once.",
