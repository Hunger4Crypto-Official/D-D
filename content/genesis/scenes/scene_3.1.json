  "title": "The Spiral Delta — Lumen Causeway Convergence",
  "narration": "The stairwells from the Spectrum Storm Balcony uncoil into a river of light that refuses to lie flat. It is called the Lumen Causeway: a skybridge made of interlocking panes of ledger glass, bending like a Möbius strip stretched across a delta of clouds. Each panel stores a memory of consensus, and when you step on it the pane plays back the echo in harmonic phi-intervals. Below you rushes an abyss of silver mist, veined with bright tributaries that run backwards, forwards, and sideways in time. When the causeway flexes, the mist bells like a cathedra of windchimes. The air smells of wet stone, ozone, starfruit rind, and the first page of an audited manifesto.\n\nAt the midpoint of the causeway stands a camp maintained by the Flux-Kindle gremlin faction: pocket-sized engineers wearing cloaks woven from reflective ticker tape. Their eyes flicker with stock-ticker constellations and their voices are half banter, half cautionary ledger entries. Around them flutter tethered lanterns shaped like polyhedral dice, each containing a golden-ratio die whose faces rotate to different outcomes depending on how you breathe. The gremlins run rope bridges, consensus pylons, and a shop that sells soft-power gear built from wind, rumor, and neatly-tracked goodwill. They joke with you like coworkers, sass you like rival hackers, and document you like beloved auditors. They hand you a ledger-slate and point to seven stations along the causeway, inviting you to walk Act Three’s first spiral.\n\nThis scene arcs like a helix: spectrum doors crackle in the distance, consensus rituals now call for not just participants but conductors, and the AFK gimbal whirs in the background, reminding you that idle feet will be gently puppeteered across the glass if they pause too long. Revive fonts hang from the underside of the bridge like stalactites, accessible by leaps of faith. Harmony flags, trustful pings, shy echoes, and insight flashes all continue to be tracked, updated, and joked about. Every step is recorded by the Ledger Stone struts, which hum the minutes of your presence into the delta below. You sense that this causeway is both a measurement and a launchpad: the Flux-Kindle are preparing you to walk on consensus itself.\n\nSeven rounds flare along the bridge like lightning caught in loops. Each round offers actions that braid phi-d20 checks with golden-ratio experience escalations, hidden difficulty thresholds disguised as scenic hazards, and the ever-present possibility of XP, Coins, Focus, Flags, Items, and even backpack pity tokens. The Flux-Kindle make sure to stage arrivals mid-scene: tether kites bring new players up from the mist and parachute them into the queue. This is a corridor that laughs while it counts; it wants you to be audaciously precise.\n\nYou hear the first consensus beacon chime. The gremlins shout a cheerful \"GM from the delta!\" and nudge you toward the initial station, where ledger light waits to be coaxed into a bridge-wide pulse.",
