  "narration": "The chamber does not wait to be admired; it watches. Black stone sweats a patient aurora of code, thin as breath and bright as cut copper. At the center rises the Ledger Stone, a shard of night veined with living glyphs that drift as though listening for your next mistake. The air tastes like static and iron. Somewhere in the walls, something old begins to turn—a cautious gear, a waking millstone.\\n\\nGremlins cling to cornices and buttresses, hand-sized and bronze-skinned, their eyes spinning like minted coins. They whisper to each other in a chorus of treble clicks that somehow feel like laughter in a foreign exchange. One cups its hands around its mouth and squeaks down at you: \\\"Make a choice, meat-wallets. The stone gets bored.\\\"\\n\\nThe floor is not flat but a memory of flatness poured yesterday and still deciding what to be. If you stand very still, you can feel the vault’s heartbeat counting time through your boots—slow, then almost slow, then not slow at all. The Ledger Stone hums and your teeth hum with it. Sparks breathe from the ceiling in lazy filaments that dangle like glass vines. Each filament knows your name in the way lightning knows a church steeple.\\n\\nYou notice small things: a thread of dust that refuses to settle; a hairline crack in the far wall that reveals not darkness but an even blacker dark; a ring carved into the floor at the stone’s base, as if the Ledger has been lifted and set back a thousand times. The ring is shallow yet absolute, like a promise made in public. If you lean in, the ring speaks faintly of oil and bitter herbs and something like salt tears. It is a place of offerings.\\n\\nThere are smells here and each one is a verb: metal (to cut), ozone (to arrive), old leather (to carry), ash (to remember). The gremlins smell faintly of coin and furnace and guilty sugar. The Ledger smells like the first rainfall on a courtyard stone that has been waiting all dry season to be itself again.\\n\\nYou have come to touch the heart of the chain, and the heart of the chain intends to touch you back. Your breath fogs in a room that has no reason to be cold. The hum resolves into something like music—first a note, then a harmony, then a rhythm, as if the vault were testing which of you will sing in key.\\n\\nSomewhere in that hum is a sentence you can almost—but not quite—hear. It brushes the inner ear and departs, leaving the shape of an answer without the question. The gremlins mimic it cruelly and get it wrong and giggle because getting it wrong is part of the fun. You stand beneath the Ledger Stone and feel a small gravity take hold. The room leans; the choice leans with it. You understand, perhaps too late, that this is not a museum. It is a test that writes the grade in light.",
